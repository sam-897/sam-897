<h1>Hi, I'm Samhita! </h1>
<p > My interests lie in data science, analysis, and machine learning. My passion for mathematics has led me to try and understand and uncover patterns and trends in various contexts, as mathematics fundamentally studies patterns. I am committed to using these skills to drive strategic opportunities and data-driven decision-making! </p>

  <h2>My Projects:</h2>

- <b>Classical Machine Learning Projects</b>
  - [Spotify Songs Recommendation](https://github.com/sam-897/classical_ml/tree/main/song_recommendation) - Developed a song recommendation system using the Spotify API and experimeneted with K-means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms.
  - [Life Expectancy Estimation](https://github.com/sam-897/classical_ml/tree/main/types_of_regression) - Estimated life expectancy using WHO data with multiple regression techniques, and achieved a 97\% R-squared score, demonstrating robust predictive performance.
  - [Recipe Rating Prediction](https://github.com/sam-897/classical_ml/tree/main/recipe_rating_prediction) - Predicted ratings by experimenting with models including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Bagging, Boosting, and MLP Classifier, using TF-IDF vectorization, thus enhancing prediction precision.
- <b>Deep Learning Projects</b>
  - [Fake Speech Detection : Self Distillation | Domain Generalization](https://github.com/sam-897/self_distillation_domain_generalization/tree/main)
    Implemented a self-distillation framework on neural networks (SENET, ECANET, RESNET) with online semi-hard triplet mining and domain adversarial learning, enhancing performance and generalization, and improving accuracy over the base model by 30\% on unseen datasets.
    <br> Conducted experiments to analyze impact of parameter perturbations and evaluate generalization ability,used hypothesis testing and visualizations to validate model performance over baseline and gain definitive understanding of data characteristics.
- <b>Database Management</b>
  - [UNICEF Data Analysis](https://github.com/sam-897/unicef_sql_analysis/tree/main) - Analyzed The State of the World's Children 2023: Statistical tables published by UNICEF using SQL on PostgreSQL to gain insights into the economic and health status, and childhood development details of countries,identifying critical areas requiring attention and support.
