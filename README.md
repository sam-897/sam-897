<h1>Hi, I'm Samhita! </h1>
<p>I have a deep passion for using mathematics to understand data, uncover patterns, and generate actionable insights. My interests lie in data science, analysis, and machine learning, and I am committed to using these skills to drive strategic opportunities and data-driven decision-making!</p>

  <h2>My Projects:</h2>

- <b>Classical Machine Learning Projects</b>
  - [Spotify Songs Recommendation](https://github.com/sam-897/classical_ml/tree/main/song_recommendation) - Developed a song recommendation system using the Spotify API and experimeneted with K-means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms.
  - [Life Expectancy Estimation](https://github.com/sam-897/classical_ml/tree/main/types_of_regression) - Estimated life expectancy using WHO data with multiple regression techniques, and achieved a 97\% R-squared score, demonstrating robust predictive performance.
  - [Recipe Rating Prediction](https://github.com/sam-897/classical_ml/tree/main/recipe_rating_prediction) - Predicted ratings by experimenting with models including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Bagging, Boosting, and MLP Classifier, using TF-IDF vectorization, thus enhancing prediction precision.
- <b>Deep Learning Projects</b>
  - [Fake Speech Detection : Self Distillation | Domain Generalization]()
    Implemented a self-distillation framework on neural networks (SENET, ECANET, RESNET) with online semi-hard triplet mining and domain adversarial learning, enhancing performance and generalization, and improving accuracy over the base model by 30\% on unseen datasets.
    <br> Conducted experiments to analyze impact of parameter perturbations and evaluate generalization ability,used hypothesis testing and visualizations to validate model performance over baseline and gain definitive understanding of data characteristics.
- <b>Database Management</b>
  - [UNICEF Data Analysis]() - Analyzed The State of the World's Children 2023: Statistical tables published by UNICEF using SQL on PostgreSQL to gain insights into the economic and health status, and childhood development details of countries,identifying critical areas requiring attention and support.
